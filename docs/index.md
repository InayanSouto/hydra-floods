# Welcome to the HYDRAFloods Documentation

The Hydrologic Remote Sensing Analysis for Floods (or HYDRAFloods) is an open source Python application for downloading, processing, and delivering surface water maps derived from remote sensing data. The bases behind the tool is to provide sensor agnostic approaches to produce surface water maps. Furthermore, there are applications that leverage multiple remote sensing dataset in conjunction to provide daily surface water maps for flood application.
